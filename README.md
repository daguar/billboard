Create an API for your screens.  

And I quote the great Tony Stark:

  Hold on one second, buddy. Let me see something here.
  Boy, I am good. I commandeered your screens.
  I need them. Time for a little transparency.



Option on all:
*set default
*min time
*max time



URL
sets the src of fullpage iframe

Image
drop in full screen image (scaled, unless otherwise specified)

Video
Play video and return to default screen when that is completed.
